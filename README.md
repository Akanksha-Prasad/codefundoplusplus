I'll make a website or an android app which I'll title as "Immediate Help During Natural Disasters".

It'll have the helpline numbers to contact in case of floods, earthquakes, droughts, etc. 

It will have links to donate money for the victims of natural disasters. The money will be transferred directly to government's distress relief funds for victims of natural calamities. 

The website will have links to get insurance for natural disasters, for instance, flood insurance.

The website will give you the location of nearby places where you can dotate clothes, utensils, medicines, bedding and other items for helping victims of floods and earthquakes.

The victims will be able to see the location of nearest relief camps where they can get free food, water, clothes and other basic items.

The website will provide links to avail low-cost loans provided by the banks to victims of natural calamities.
