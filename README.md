I'll make a website or an android app which I'll title as "Immediate Help During Natural Disasters".

It'll have the helpline numbers to contact in case of floods, earthquakes, droughts, etc. The user will have an option of placing a call and the call will be auto-directed to the most available helpline number using AI bot.

It will have links to donate money for the victims of natural disasters. The money will be transferred directly to government's distress relief funds for victims of natural calamities using Banking APIs. 

The website will have links to get insurance for natural disasters, for instance, flood insurance.

The website will give you the location of nearby places where you can dotate clothes, utensils, medicines, bedding and other items for helping victims of floods and earthquakes.

The victims will be able to see the location of nearest relief camps where they can get free food, water, clothes and other basic items. The victim will enter his location and the items which he needs. According to his location and availability of the items at the relief camps, most optimum and nearest relief camp's address will be displayed using Machine Learning algorithm.

The website will provide links to avail low-cost loans provided by the banks to victims of natural calamities.
